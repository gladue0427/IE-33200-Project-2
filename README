requirements to run:
- download model.zip/model.tar and data-for-332.tar.gz from Brightspace
- unzip/extract folders
- move "dandelion_model" from the "model" folder to the root project folder (IE-33200-Project-2)
- move "grass" and "dandelions" from "data-for-332" to the root project folder
- do not rename files, it will probably mess stuff up

- download Python (I used anaconda3)
- In the Rstudio menu bar, go to Tools -> Global Options -> Python and select Python interpreter
          - your downloaded version should show up automatically
- install packages tidyverse, keras, tensorflow, and reticulate
- run library() commands at top of orig_model.R
- run install_tensorflow() line in orig_model.R
    - do this separately from any other install steps because it may take a while
- run install_keras() line

- make sure your working directory is the root project folder
- run model <- load_model_tf() line
